# Sequel Design Conventions

The UX rules that make Project Hub and the Acquisition Hub feel like one product family. Every new Sequel application adopts these from day one. Rules marked **(code)** are enforced or embodied by a module in this repo; the rest are conventions to carry into the app.

## 1. Brand & theming

- **One token mechanism** (code: `brand/tokens.css`, `brand/theme.css`). All color flows through CSS custom properties; Tailwind utilities reference tokens (`bg-brand`, `text-brand-navy`), never raw hexes. Tailwind's default `blue-*` ramp is remapped to brand blues so third-party-ish code adopts the brand automatically.
- **Dark mode is an attribute, not a media query** (code: `theme/theme.ts`, `ThemeToggle`). The resolved theme is stamped on `<html data-theme>` by a pre-hydration script (no flash), a three-state Light / Dark / Browser toggle persists in localStorage, and Tailwind's `dark:` variant is re-keyed to the attribute. Per-app localStorage key (`pi.theme`, `hub.theme`, …) so apps don't fight; the auto mode is stored as `"system"` and **labeled "Browser"** (it reads `prefers-color-scheme`, which is the browser's setting).
- **The dark yellow problem**: dark mode gets its own lightened/desaturated status values (see `theme.css`), never the light palette on a dark ground. Don't invent per-app dark values.
- **Montserrat everywhere** — UI, docx, xlsx, pptx. Monospace is Geist Mono. Load via `next/font/google` with `--font-montserrat` / `--font-geist-mono` variables.

## 2. Color semantics

- **Chartreuse accent = hand-off.** The lime accent (`#CAD400`) is reserved for assign / hand-off / delegate actions (code: `Button` variant `accent`). Views and passive links stay arrow-less and non-accent. Accent buttons take dark ink (zinc-900), never navy — navy washes out on lime, in both themes.
- **Icon + label, never color alone.** Every status indicator pairs a shape/icon with text: the ApprovedBadge check-circle + "Approved · date" (code: `ui/StatusBadges.tsx`), RYG dots next to status words, the dumbbell chart's hollow-start/filled-end dots. This is an accessibility floor, not a style choice.
- **RYG stoplight vocabulary** (code: tokens in `theme.css`). Green / Yellow / Red / None, with separate `-text` variants for colored text. Thresholds are computed by shared pure helpers (see §4), and the same tokens drive UI chips and deck dot-cells.
- **Maroon (`#8C1D2D`) for critical rows in decks** — an emphasized table row must not reuse the navy header fill or it reads as a second header.

## 3. Interaction & state

- **Explicit sign-off for commitment actions; auto-advance only trivial transitions.** Anything that implies acknowledgement, approval, or an auditable decision (completing a gate, approving a phase, adopting a baseline) is an explicit user action — the apps are the record a steering committee reads. Auto-advancing "you typed something → in progress" is fine and appreciated.
- **Save-state chip idiom** (code: `ui/SaveState.tsx`): `Saving… → Unsaved changes → Saved · 2:14 PM`. Toasts confirm saves; error toasts linger longer than confirmations (code: `ui/toast/`).
- **Every mutation ends with confirmation + a next step — never silence.** After any user action that changes data, the user must see (a) that it worked and (b) where to go from there: a toast with a contextual action link (`toastSaved("PM assigned", { action: { label: "View project →", href } })`), an inline `SaveStateIndicator` on form surfaces, or a redirect that lands on the affected entity. `router.refresh()` alone is not feedback. Queue rows must never silently vanish on success — confirm the action and offer the entity or the next item (code: `ui/toast/` action links; the toast ttl stretches when a link is attached).
- **Saving keeps you in place** (code: `ui/SectionSave.tsx`). A successful save never navigates away from the form — the confirmation is the toast plus the SaveState chip, and the user decides when to leave (Cancel / the origin-aware back link). Redirect-on-save is reserved for CREATE flows, which land on the newly created entity. List-row inline actions refresh in place.
- **Save is disabled until something changed** (code: `ui/SectionSave.tsx` + `ui/form-dirty.ts`). Every Save button is dirty-aware — disabled with "No changes to save" on its title until the form actually differs from its loaded state (`useFormDirty` snapshots uncontrolled forms; `shallowDirty` compares controlled state). A Save that would PATCH nothing is noise and a false audit entry.
- **Long forms save per section** (code: `ui/SectionSaveBar`). A form tall enough to scroll carries a compact Save bar inside each section (fieldset) so committing never requires scrolling to the bottom; the bottom Save-all remains for the full sweep. Both are dirty-aware, both confirm in place.
- **Navigation shows pending state too** (code: `ui/NavProgress`, `ui/LinkPendingHint`). A route transition that blocks on server work is an action like any other — it gets feedback within ~1s (NN/g response-time limits). Three layers, outermost first: `<NavProgress/>` mounted once in the root layout paints a brand-blue top bar on every internal link click and back/forward (fetch-then-push flows call `startNavProgress()` next to the fetch); slow segments ship a `loading.tsx` skeleton so the destination answers immediately; high-traffic tiles add an inline `LinkPendingHint` ("Opening…") on the control the user clicked. Every indicator holds invisible for its first ~250ms so fast hops never flicker.
- **Back to top on long scroll surfaces** (code: `ui/BackToTop`). Any page that regularly runs past ~4 screens mounts the floating pill; it appears only past ~2.5 viewports of scroll *and* on upward scroll intent (NN/g back-to-top guidelines), so short pages and downward reading never see it. Quiet outline styling — never the accent — icon + label, `data-no-print`. Pair with a sticky section jump-nav when the page has named sections; back-to-top gets you *up*, the jump-nav gets you *around*.
- **Locked areas render as non-links** — `role="link" aria-disabled` with the reason printed on the tile ("Complete due diligence to unlock"), never a dead `<a href>` and never a hidden tile (GOV.UK "cannot start yet" + NN/g). Server routes redirect locked URLs; the PATCH/API layer enforces the same rule. **Keep all enforcement layers in agreement** — UI affordance, server redirect, API validation.
- **Progressive disclosure for long lists** (code: `ui/ShowMore.tsx`): "Show N more / Show all (X) / Show fewer" with a live "Showing X of Y" count. No unbounded lists, no silent truncation.
- **Working-ahead warnings, not locks, for soft dependencies** — an amber banner ("Phase 1 is not yet completed…") when a user works in a later phase, reserved locks for hard gates.

## 4. Architecture principles

- **Shared pure helpers when UI and an exporter compute the same thing.** If a filter/sort/score appears in a `.tsx` view and a deck/workbook exporter, extract it to a plain function that takes the domain object, and unit-test it. The preview and the download must call the same function — execs must read what the analyst just reviewed.
- **Domain knowledge lives in content/templates, generators assemble.** Editable-by-non-engineers content (KPI libraries, phase templates, question catalogs, model constants) stays in data modules; logic modules stay generic.
- **LLM model selection is configuration** (code: `llm/models.ts`). Call sites declare a task class (`prose` | `presentation`) and go through `modelFor` + `withModelFallback`; adopting a new model is an env-var change. Never hardcode a model id at a call site.
- **Cache-stable system prompts.** The large static framework prompt is the cache target (`cache_control: ephemeral`); all per-request data goes in the user message. Never interpolate timestamps/UUIDs/names into the system prompt.
- **Typed exceptions, never string-matching** (code: `llm/http.ts`). Map SDK error classes to `{status, error}`.
- **Streaming beats platform timeouts** (code: `llm/stream.ts` + `stream-client.ts`). Any LLM-backed route streams SSE with heartbeats (`streamJob`), and the browser collapses it back to one awaited value (`consumeLlmStream`). Jobs that exceed the streamed-function cap (~60s on Netlify) go to a background function returning **202 + poll**.
- **Registry-driven surfaces.** Exports, admin areas, and home tiles are data (a registry array), and the UI renders the registry. Adding a capability = appending a descriptor, not hand-editing three components.

## 5. Navigation & structure

- **Tile ↔ menu parity.** Every hub tile appears in that section's nav dropdown, added in the same PR, both rendered from one shared registry — locked by a parity unit test so a hand-edited menu can't drift.
- **Breadcrumbs on nested routes** (code: `ui/Breadcrumbs.tsx`); the last crumb is the current page, unlinked, `aria-current`.
- **Origin-aware back-nav via a strict allow-list registry.** Deep links into an entity page carry `?from=<origin-key>`; the page resolves the key against a registry (`{ key → { label, href } }`) to render "← Back to {label}", and threads the key through edit round-trips (`returnHref`). Never echo the raw param into an href; guard lookups with `Object.hasOwn`; unknown keys fall back to the default back target. A subpage may consume a *single* origin key by strict equality when only one flow lands there — comment it as deliberately not generalized.
- **Tabs are URLs.** Tabbed views drive the active tab from a query param through a strict allow-list (`?tab=`, `?view=`), rendered as `<Link scroll={false}>` with `aria-current="page"` — deep-linkable, in history, shareable. Links launched from inside a tab stamp the launching tab so returning lands where the user left. The default tab is the bare URL (omit the param when canonical).
- **Queues act-and-advance.** A worklist (assignment queue, triage inbox, approval list) never strands the user after an action: the item's departure is confirmed (toast + link, per §3), a session-local record strip preserves what was just done, visited/handled rows are marked (icon + label), and the surface the queue hands off to offers a way back to the queue. Entity names rendered anywhere (tables, cards, panels) are links to their detail page — a plain-text name with a detail page is a dead-end micro-moment.
- **No zero-exit pages.** Every page offers at least one contextual next step beyond the global nav. Empty states double as navigation: explain what belongs here and link the create/next action.
- **Print is a feature** (code: print block in `theme.css` + `ui/ExportBar.tsx`): every read-only view saves cleanly to PDF; chrome and export buttons carry `data-no-print`.

## 5a. Navigation & flow review checklist

Run on every new/changed page and flow (synthesized from NN/g cognitive-walkthrough + menu/breadcrumb guidance, GOV.UK confirmation pages, Baymard back-button research, MeasuringU first-click). Score pass/fail; rate failures 0–4 (frequency × impact × persistence); fix 3s and 4s before merge.

Per page:
- **P1 Where am I?** — current section lit in the nav; title matches the link that got you here.
- **P2 Where can I go?** — global nav present; breadcrumb when ≥3 levels deep.
- **P3 First click is obvious** — a fresh colleague's first click for the page's #1 task is correct.
- **P4 No dead end** — ≥1 contextual next-step link beyond the global nav.
- **P5 Empty state navigates** — zero-data view explains + offers the create/next CTA.
- **P6 Back behaves** — back returns to the perceived previous view with state intact.

Per flow:
- **F1 Walkthrough** — at each step: right goal / control noticed / label connects / progress visible.
- **F2 Exit at every step** — cancel/back available, non-destructive; no trap states.
- **F3 Completion answers "what now?"** — confirmation + next-step link (§3 post-action rule).
- **F4 Queue actions advance** — next item or state-preserved return, never a dead stop.
- **F5 Path isn't lost-making** — the happy path is short and each hop is a confident choice; don't budget clicks, budget confusion per click.

## 6. Accessibility floor

- Visible brand focus ring on keyboard focus (`:focus-visible`, in `theme.css`), never removed.
- Minimum tap-target heights on all buttons (code: `ui/Button.tsx` sizes).
- `aria-live` on dynamic counts; `role="alert"` on danger callouts, `role="status"` elsewhere (code: `ui/Callout.tsx`).
- WCAG ≥ 4.5:1 for text chips (the emerald badge pairing is pre-checked).
- **Motion honors `prefers-reduced-motion`** (code: motion tokens + reduced-motion overrides in `theme.css`). Animated affordances drop the animation but keep the feedback visible — the nav bar becomes a static translucent strip, fade-ins appear instantly, `BackToTop` scrolls without smoothing. Information never rides on motion alone.

## 7. Writing & labels

- **Title-case for buttons, tiles, and nav items**; sentence case for body and hints.
- **The arrow (→) means hand-off** — pair it with accent actions; plain views stay arrow-less.
- Say what unlocks a locked thing ("Complete due diligence to unlock"), not just that it's locked.
- Error messages name the likely cause and the fix ("the configured API key lacks permission for this model — check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY").

## 8. Verification habits

- **Verify every render state a change touches** — pre-gate and post-gate, with and without an active record, empty/error/loading — not just the state you developed in.
- **Every user-facing PR regenerates the app's guide** in the same PR (docs-kit convention): the guide is a committed artifact and drifts silently otherwise. Validate by extracting the docx text and checking new wording present, stale wording absent.
- Deck/exporter changes follow the render-verify workflow in [DECK-CRAFT.md](./DECK-CRAFT.md).
